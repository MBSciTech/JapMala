# JapMala
Jap Mala is a minimalist web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that replicates the experience of a traditional japa mala in digital form. Each scroll action represents one bead, incrementing the chant count by +1, allowing users to perform mantra repetition in a focused and distraction-free way.
